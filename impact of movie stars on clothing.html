<div class="articlehead">Dressing up the movie stars' way</div>

<div class="articlebyline">April 12, 2016<br>
<em>by</em> DIVYA NARAYANAN <em>and</em> DIVYA RAJENDRAN</div>
<br>

<div class="articlebody">
  <p>Fashion in the world of today is not meant for just celebrities and runway models. Media has exposed common people to the world of fashion. Television, newspapers, internet, movies and all other means of communication have exposed people to the fashion trends.    </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Celebrities shape and influence fashion trends. Famous people have always shaped fashion trends throughout history and this is still true today. What is fashion? Fashion is just wearing what is considered popular or hip. Why certain things are considered hip or popular? It is usually because famous people or celebrities have been seen wearing these things. So, celebrities not only influence fashion, but also create fashion. Celebrities are often our inspiration for what to wear. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>During the 20th century, film has been a powerful media in which to influence people's lifestyles and human behaviour. Film is for people who do not enjoy reading or other more stimulating leisure and want to be entertained or escape from everyday life. Movies gave society a great way to see vintage fashion, including how to wear period accessories that accompany the clothing. Movies also gave society a view of actors portraying wartime heroes, rebels or gangsters, which may influence people’s human behaviour. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The film industry introduced flapper movies in the early days. The flapper wore short hair and a short skirt, with turned-down hose and powdered knees. The flapper must have seemed to her mother like a rebel. Flappers offended the older generation because they defied conventions of acceptable feminine behaviour. They used make-up and wore baggy dresses, which often exposed their arms as well as their legs from the knees down. The flapper movies were modern and influenced a revolution in fashion. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When looking back on the film history of the 20th century you begin to realize the great impact these films had on people's lifestyles and human behaviour. Movies influenced the way people dressed and the way people acted. We as, movie goers, must choose what is morally right or wrong and not be influenced by the film industry. We must also choose what a fashion statement is and what is not. The film industry may be protected under the freedom of speech amendment, but we do not have to be influenced by what they project in their movies. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fashion world has undergone many and notable changes with time. It is really hard in coping up with such furiously changing trends and styles. World-class fashion houses and gurus bring in new lines each season with wide variety of trends, styles, colors, themes and patterns. Although it is quite tough to keep up with ever changing fashion trends, but at the same time it allows one to add all fresh and new fun to the wardrobe. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Indeed, fashion can be seen in all the areas of our life. Fashion designing in today’s era has become one of the lucrative professions. Fashion shows or parades are organized on regular intervals showcasing the latest and modish dresses. Myriad of outfits are heaped in the markets which can be selected as per the needs or any kind of occasions. Cheapest source to witness fashion is termed as movies as most of the young people copy the fashion from films only. Fashion is also considered as the best way to instill confidence in the mind of youngsters. It is promoted to enrich one’s lifestyle! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Global evidence of media influence on the behaviour of young people </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A considerable body of research from developed countries, particularly the US, suggests that the visual media influence a broad range of attitudes and behaviours among young people and may exacerbate risky practices. These studies have largely followed the “media-effects” model and explored the impact of the media on certain risk-taking behaviours such as engaging in sex, use of tobacco and alcohol, aggression and violence as well as such other behaviours as adopting new clothing styles and mannerisms, among others. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fashion among young people has become so huge and youths are becoming more influential and powerful in the fashion scene with world class high fashion designers. Popular fashion sites like look book and such helps young people to publicize their different fashion views and also let them comment about the latest fashion trends in the movies. They inspire the fashion industry as they make high fashion looks with affordable items. This would be a huge change to the society as fashion had always been based on exclusivity and youths are changing the 'game' with their brilliance and with the help of the internet.
    Media exposure is also seen as greatly influencing youth ideas of fashion, their choices of clothing and accessories. For example, a survey examining the self-perceived influence of the family, friends and the media on the clothing choice of 478 adolescents in the 6th, 9th and 12th grades in two mid-western school districts in the US observed that black adolescents’ choice of clothing and accessories was more likely to be influenced by the media than by family and friends, while white adolescents were more influenced by friends than by family and the media. Further, relative to clothing choices of all adolescents, the media was less influential with females, gained influence as adolescents’ age, and had almost twice as much influence on urban adolescents as rural (Wilson and MacGillivray, 1998). Schwartz found that the media can provide information on fashion, beauty and body satisfaction, and has the potential to provide positive images for adolescents in the process of their social development and emerging sense of identity, of which fashion decisions are a part (Schwartz, 2004).  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence of media influence on the behaviour of young people in India</strong> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In India, research on the visual media has focused, by and large, on content analysis of media messages. These studies have assumed that the visual media significantly influence attitudes and behaviours and, as such, have sought to highlight the specific content areas in which the (negative) influence of the media is especially serious. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Media influence on behaviour </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Studies in the Indian context have found that films and TV are an integral part of youth sub-culture. Focus group discussions conducted with 16–18 year olds in Delhi and Mumbai to understand the relevance of Indian cinema in the context of teenage lifestyles and behavior noted that films serve as a medium through which young people are presented with new ideas about dress codes, behavior or attitude which they often imitate and use in their daily interactions with friends and acquaintances (WHO, 2003). Films/ actors were part of everyday conversation with friends, evoking a desire to imitate the looks and mannerisms of their favourite actors. Goswami and Kashyap also found that imitating hairstyles, clothing and accessories of actors in popular films was widespread among both urban as well as rural youth (Goswami and Kashyap, 2006). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Hindi movie industry based in Mumbai, popularly known as ‘Bollywood’, has influenced daily life and culture in India for decades now. In fact, movies are the mainstay of entertainment and almost a religion in the nation. Attend any Indian wedding and you will find the ladies attired in the finest garments modelled after Bollywood fashion and revellers dancing to throbbing hit songs during the ‘baraat’. To study this influence a survey was conducted among 177 students of M.O.P. Vaishnav College for Women with the following objectives: i) To study the significance of influence of cinema in the way young women perceive fashion, ii) To study the impact movies have on the fashion choices young women make, iii) To study the impact of movie stars on the clothing choices of young women, iv) To identify the movie stars who the young women consider a fashion icon and replicate their style. The respondents were chosen through simple random sampling method. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For years fashion has influenced films and films have clearly influenced fashion. The relationship between the fashion houses, the stylists and the film studios has always been strong. The survey results mirrors this concepts as 45% of the respondents think they are fashionable. 52% of young women think that it is slightly important to be fashionable while 24% of the respondents think that it is very important to be fashionable.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Bollywood has for long exerted a deep influence on popular Indian fashion. On an average 85% of young women watch movies, around 50% of them only watched movies once in a week, while 19% of them watched movies daily. Any outfit adorned by an actor or actress in a hit movie immediately becomes a prime sartorial trend for tailors to reproduce. Likewise Around 70% of the respondents observed the way stars dress in movies. And, 62% of them liked the way the stars dress. The ready-made industry manufactures these clothes in bulk and the designs are named after the character or movie, for example, the anarkali suit, the jewellery in Jodha Akbar (2008) and the masakali suit from Delhi-6 (2009) to name just a few. As a result 30% of the respondents dress the way the movie stars dress because they like it. Also, 32% of them change their wardrobe to match the recent trend in movie fashion.  48% of them dress like their favourite stars sometimes. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When it comes to style, then we can talk about this current generation, where actors and actresses are very conscious of what they wear and how they look. Talking about the beautiful ladies, it again had a merger of traditional as well as ultra-modern attires. On being asked who they think is a fashionable among the movie stars, 14% responded with Deepika padukone, 6% responded with Sonam Kapoor, while the remaining 80% had mixed opinions. This is the most stylish lot till now and the trend is going more towards skin show and westernization. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>People worship actors and feel a deep connection with their charisma. Film and fashion have always had a very intimate relationship with each other. Cinema takes the audiences into a dream world and they try to imitate the actors by emulating them. Till now, the madness is enormously increasing in the zillions of fans day by day; hope the coming years will be vivacious, fashionable, trendy and more fun filled. </p>
