<div class="col-md-6" align="center"> For years fashion has influenced films and films have clearly influenced fashion. The relationship between the fashion houses, the stylists and the film studios has always been strong. 
Hollywood has always been enthralled by the fashion industry. Movie stars today grace many of the magazine covers that was once restrained for top models and the red carpet at the Oscars has become the biggest catwalk show in the world.
The early silent screen actresses were as much fashion leaders as cinema stars. Louise Brooks’ bobbed haircut remains iconic almost one hundred years after she first wore it. Gloria Swanson was as famous for her style and fashion influence as for her dramatic performances, being one of the most photographed women of the age in her 1920s heyday. It was not the first or last time that Hollywood would influence consumer fashion. Howard Hawk’s silent 1926 comedy Fig Leaves made a running joke of stylish actresses influencing the ordinary woman on the street, opening with a scene where Eve complains to Adam that she hasn’t got a stitch to wear before flashing forward to contemporary New York where an ordinary working Joe protests bitterly when his wife secretly becomes a famous catwalk model and screen actress, in order to get her hands on free frocks.
No slave to fashion, when Katherine Hepburn flouted convention in the 1930s and wore trousers and jeans, onscreen and off, it created a scandal and a fashion craze at the same time. Joan Crawford’s angular costumes championed the use of shoulder-pads while Veronica Lake’s “peek-a-boo” hairstyle was expressly forbidden by the war-time US government, to stop women who copied the hairdo getting tangled up in factory machinery.
Since the dawn of the 20th century, the movies have been the most enduring entertainment for the masses and the most effective distribution channel for new fashion trends. Fashion and film are two artistic disciplines that flirt with each other in a symbiotic relationship where movie stars disseminate the new trends, and their personal styles influence the spectacular wardrobes of the films in which they appear.
A clear example of this predicament is Marlene Dietrich. The great diva of 1930’s cinema made her debut in with The Blue Angel, the first European sound film, directed by Josef von Sternberg. In it, she shows a slim silhouette that did not correspond to the patterns of the time. At the same time, Dietrich’s wardrobe on screen was the precursor of the revolutionary androgynous style, which continues to influence the way women dress today.
Soon after, Dietrich shocked the world in the film Morocco, appearing in top hat, tails and bow tie. She was already working with great Hollywood designers such as Travis Banton, Edith Head and Jean Louis. Throughout her life, Marlene Dietrich was dressed by many of fashion’s greatest legends, including Lanvin, Lelong and Vionnet. 
When we talk about screen characters whose personality and style have captivated the public’s imagination, one cannot ignore Holly Golightly, played by Audrey Hepburn in Blake Edwards’ 1961 romantic comedy Breakfast at Tiffany's. Until the day she died, Audrey Hepburn was considered one of the most elegant women who ever lived. Her black sunglasses from Breakfast at Tiffany’s became the rage among young women of the time. The film was also the outlet for Hubert Givenchy to reintroduced Coco Chanel’s 1920s petite robe noir. If you ask any woman today to mention her one indispensable piece, most will tell you they cannot live without the little black dress. Hepburn adopted Givenchy as her personal couturier, turning their relationship into one of the most fruitful collaborations between fashion designers and movie stars.
Another equally fruitful partnership born on the set occurred between actress Catherine Deneuve and designer Yves Saint Laurent, to whom the filmmaker Luis Buñuel commissioned, in 1967, the wardrobe Deneuve would wear in the cinematic masterpiece Belle de Jour. With this role, Deneuve became the muse of the leading designers of her time.
When it comes to actors, Cary Grant is, undoubtedly, the epitome of classic elegance. His standout performances were always complemented with a great sense of style, making him the most adored leading man of his generation. Meanwhile, Humphrey Bogart popularized the trench coat in the iconic film Casablanca, directed by Michael Curtiz in 1942. As its name implies, trench coats were used mainly in military uniforms. After Bogart, men of all ages continue to include this piece in their elegant wardrobes.
The simple, urban style of James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, directed by Nicholas Ray in 1955, is one of the most influential shifts in 20th menswear. The combination of jeans, basic T-shirts and worn boots, clothes that until then were only used for work, found a place in the closets of young men around the world.
From the beginning, the movies also lured many of the most brilliant haute couture designers of the last century. When Hollywood became the Mecca of Cinema, Madeleine Vionnet, Madame Grès and Mariano Fortuny did not hesitate to travel from Europe to work in major movie studios in Los Angeles.
The Spanish couturier Balenciaga was also attracted by the cinema and even designed the costumes for more than twenty films featuring the most renowned stars. But only the great Christian Dior won the Oscar in 1953 for Best Costume Design for his work on the film Termini Station, by the Italian director Vittorio de Sica.
At the crossroads of film and fashion, it is also very common to see famous actors and actresses posing for fashion magazines and modelling for top designers. Similarly, several top fashion models have made the leap to the big screen.
In addition, for many years, the Oscars have become a great fashion spectacle for the world, where designers seeking the widest exposure choose the actors and actresses who best represent the values of their labels. Also, the fashion world has been a compelling argument for movies. To mention just two examples: Prêt-à-Porter by Robert Altman and The Devil Wears Prada by David Frankel.
On the other side of the world in India, Bollywood has been the fashion dictator for years, so it isn’t surprising that Bollywood and fashion go hand-in-hand. Bollywood has always had immense influence on the people across the country, the actors set trends and the fans follow them madly. This is often a product of the love that followers have for Bollywood. People worship actors and feel a deep connection with their charisma. Bollywood and fashion have always had a very intimate relationship with each other. Cinema takes the audiences into a dream world and they try to imitate the actors by emulating them.
Talking about different eras of cinematic growth, a different trend has been set in every era.  1950’s was the period of legends like Madhubala, Nutan, Meena Kumari, Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Kishore Kumar and many more. The tilt was more towards simplicity and traditional clothes like sarees with printed or plain blouses, with puffed short sleeves. Further, western dresses comprised of long middy dresses as at that time revealing clothes were not considered ethical for women.  Regarding the male counterparts, they also wore traditional attires like kurta pyjama & dhoti kurta and the westerns avatars included suits with ties. Men mainly kept their hair short and used accessories like hats and women used to keep their hair open, or plated or they tied them in a bun.
Entering now the era of the 1960’s , this was a complete change from the earlier one, with fitted churidars & kurtis, anarkali attires and the special Mumtaz sarees came onto the silver screen. This attire revolutionized the fashion sense of the generation and they went mad for the so unusual Sadhna cut, high hair buns, skin tight clothes, extended eye liners and huge earrings. This period brought a bit of glamour and experimentation in the audiences. Major actors who lit up the screen with their mammoth presence were Shammi Kapoor, Dharmendra, Manoj Kumar, Sunil Dutt, Rajesh Khanna, Asha Parikh, Saira Bano and Sharmila Tagore.  The male lead generally preferred western outfits.
The 70’s was a treat to the audience’s eyes,  it was flowering with novel and bold ideas featuring idols like Amitabh Bacchan, Sanjeev Kumar, Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, Jeetendra, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini, Zeenat Aman, Parveen Babi etc.  This epoch impress ionized the young fans with platform heels, bell bottoms, sunglasses, maxi dresses and chunky jewellery. Men also played with their hair, keeping them long with noticeable side burns. They also carried skin tight blazers with broad ties.
The trends of the 70’s were fading with time, and various colours were covering the silver screen. Denim was in, with a different and rugged looks for the male lead and plain sarees for the female counterpart. The stars of the 80’s were Sridevi, Amrita Singh, Poonam Dhillon, Govinda, Mithun Chakroborty, Jackie Shroff, Anil Kapoor and the list continues. Talking about the hair styles, it only meant volume, and the girls were also crazy about Dimple Kapadia’s hair style in Saagar.
Here comes the era of the fashion designers like Manish Malhotra, who with their vivid trials transformed Bollywood’s fashion sense. With beauties like Madhuri Dikshit, Raveena Tandon, Kajol, Juhi Chawla, Karishma Kapoor, Urmila Matondkar and Manisha Koirala the exquisite creations were showcased. The trend was more towards fitted skirts, high heel boots, hair bands, big jewellery and scarves. The men usually wore baggy pants, denims, dungarees etc. The college crowd imitated the actors completely.
When it comes to style, then we can talk about this period, where actors and actresses are very conscious of what they wear and how they look. Talking about the beautiful ladies, it again had a merger of traditional as well as ultra-modern attires. The gorgeous actresses include Kareena Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bacchan, Priyanka Chopra, Bipasha Basu, Preity Zinta, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor and many more. This is the most stylish lot till now and the trend is going more towards skin show and westernization.
Men have become more conscious and wear designer brands, some trendy glares, styled wet hair with consistent grooming. The actors who are thankfully responsible for this modification are Shahrukh Khan, Arjun Rampal, Shahid Kapoor, Abhishek Bacchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan.
Till now, the madness is enormously increasing in the zillions of fans day by day; hope the coming years will be vivacious, fashionable, trendy and more fun filled.

Let’s look at some of the most iconic movies that brought in a new style wave with them. 
Evening In Paris 
Released in 1967, the highlight of this movie was Sharmila Tagore. She wore a bikini on the big screen for the first time and looked like a million bucks. The blue swimsuit and the toned body revolutionized cinema forever. 
Rangeela 
Released in 1995, this film defined “sexy”. Urmila Matondkar grooved to Tanha Tanha in bright twin sets. Her white bustier with the matching frilly skirt is still one of the most iconic pieces in Indian cinema. A special mention goes to her ankle boots and the red dress in Kya Kare. 
Raja Hindustani 
This movie is a landmark in every aspect. From the straight hair, to the outfits; everything deserves applause. Mr. Manish Malhotra, you did well. There was always only one point of focus in every outfit. From the bright colored sarees to her suits, the animal print blazer to her red lace dress. It was minimalistic, yet powerful. 
Dil Toh Pagal Hai
This first name that comes to my mind is Karisma Kapoor. I personally believe that what Salman Khan has done for men’s fitness, Karisma Kapoor has done for women’s fashion. Weather she was wearing shorts with a sports bra or t-shirt dresses and that aqua green gown, this movie put Karisma Kapoor on the style map. 

Kuch Kuch Hota Hai
This movie changed every aspect of college dressing: the short hair with head bands, the ‘cool’ necklace, Polo Sport tees, Gap sweatshirts, friendship bands, Tommy Hilfiger bag sacks. It made people more aware of foreign brands. Suddenly, going to college became much more fashionable. 
Main Hoon Na 
This movie had Sushmita Sen as the hot chemistry teacher who wore chiffon sarees. The twist here was that the sarees were bright with vibrant patterns. The blouses varied from being halter, bikini tops, and sleeveless with bows at the back. Who can forget the red saree from “Gori Gori”? This movie had boys all over the world hoping and wishing their chemistry teacher looked like Chandini a.k.a Sushmita Sen. 
Jab We Met Jab We Met 
Where do I even begin? This is one of the major cult movies of our time. We saw patialas in a whole new light when Kareena Kapoor wore them with long tees. She also accessorized her jeans with colorful scarves, jhumkas, payals, and red nails. It was fresh, colorful, and Punjabi, all at once. 
Tashan 
It brought with it the size zero craze. Suddenly, Kareena Kapoor Khan‘s body was trending. This was Bollywood’s version of Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. 
Aisha 
This movie was a breath of fresh air. Based on Jane Austen’s Emma, this movie was a cross between the Sex And The City with Gossip Girl. The movie introduced Christian Dior, Chanel, Ferragamo and its likes to the Indian market. 
Cocktail 
From the ultra-glam Deepika Padukone to the girl next door, Diana Penty, this movie’s style was complementary with each character. It showed Deepika with big hair, smokey eyes, sequinned dresses, and high heels as the ultimate party animal. She also rocked aztec printed skirts, palazzo pants, crop tops and fish-tail braids for some casual, unfussy glam. 
This ever changing and enthralling relationship between fashion and films is one worth paying close attention to in the years ahead.
