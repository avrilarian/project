<div class="articlehead">The art of Display</div>

<div class="articlebyline">April 12, 2016<br>
<em>by</em> VAITHEESWARI DAMODARAN</div>
<br>

<div class="articlebody">
  <p>Have you ever visited a mall with no plans to shop but returned with an armload of-shopping bags? Have you ever felt compelled to buy something? Do you make impulsive purchases, and feel guilty about them? Here is a fact to ease the guilt: it may not entirely be on you. Stores can appear tempting to us because products are displayed so attractively that they influence our buying decision. There is an entire discipline of retailand design dedicated to the study of this influence, called Visual Merchandising (VM). Simply put, VM is the effective presentation of products that impact purchase. The environment in which these products are kept also plays an instrumental role in creating the impact; and so everything that a customer sees at a store becomes a part of the store’s VM. These include the store exteriors (window display, façade, retail premises) which attract a customer and influence store selection, and interiors (merchandising, point-of-sales, and architectural display) which can help in lowering a customer's psychological defence against making a purchase.
    
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Visual Merchandising in India
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In India, VM has come a long way since the advent of organised retail. Changes in the industry started since the mid 90s in India. Initially VM was all about direction signage, arranging merchandise size-wise, and colour blocking. Then the past decade saw strong emphasis on window displays, propping, visuals, etc. Today I see that the windows are more styled and concept-based; they have a story. Steady growth of organised retail led to evolution in the roles of visual merchandisers in the industry. We must credit the departmental store concept, and pioneers such as Shopper’s Stop for bringing this discipline to India in an organised manner. The shop-in-shop concept gave each brand an exclusive space within a store. And with the success of this concept, brands started having standalone stores. Organised retail entered the industry through the departmental stores. Earlier, even brands were operating in an unorganised manner. Changes in government policies around the same time (early 90s) opened the gates for foreign brands to open stores in Indian markets, catalysing the evolution of VM in the country. 
    
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Functioning in India
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The country is witnessing a whopping growth rate in the retail sector, but organised retail trade accounts for less than 15 percent of the total retail trade. (In developed countries, this figure is nearly 80 percent.) Visual merchandising as a discipline lies within the scope of organised retail. Today, VM is an important aspect of retail in all homegrown brands, and is formally taught at various institutes in the country.As a discipline, VM demands a mix of creativity and business understanding."If you have an adequate amount of aesthetic appreciation and you can blend it with business acumen, you could be a great visual merchandiser.” Elaborating further, VM is an interdisciplinary program where basic knowledge of design, business, consumer behaviour and psychology are important. “You have to understand creative aspects like colour, texture and space management. On the other hand, you need to understand the commercial aspects of space productivity: whether we are getting enough returns for the space for which We are paying the rent.”A visual merchandiser has to develop a retail space strategically, aligning it with the retail agenda, marketing communication, and brand goals. Based on these, the VM stories and concepts are designed, and executed at the store level. The ultimate goal is to convince the customer to make a purchase. As an essential function of retail, most brands with an offline presence have an in-house VM team. Yet, VM projects are often outsourced to independent firms and freelancers. Krati Sharma, a freelance visual merchandiser, gives us an insight into the nature of the projects that are outsourced, “It may at times be the repetitive work or the creative conceptualistion part  that the brands may outsource, depending on the capabilities of their own teams. There are a lot of clients looking for end-to-end, concept-to-execution services as well, but these are mostly smaller startup brands that do not have their own in-house team.” Sharma has worked with leading apparel brands such as Levi Strauss and Van Heusen for over seven years and has recently ventured into freelance.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One of the main reasons for a brand to outsource their VM work is shortage of manpower. Unlike Western countries, the ratio of VM team members to the stores they handle is quite skewed in India. “Let’s take a brand X that has 200 stores. To handle the concept and execution of these 200 stores, the brand will have, say, three people in the head office and they might have one or two people in the field. This is the scenario today. There are a few companies which have 700 stores with only seven or eight people in the VM team. Shopper’s Stop put special emphasis on theirVM, as it is one of the most important tools for attracting customers. In Shopper’s Stop, since the brand has stores across the country, a local dependency is necessary for execution of concepts, but the conceptualization is always done by the in-house VM teams. In proportion to an MBO, a brand spends considerably larger amounts on marketing activities such as print ads, television commercials, etc. These are to build a brand; most of the merchandise sales of a brand are actually made through MBOs.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Exclusive Brand Outlets (EBOs) focus on the experience of the customer inside the store. The VM at an EBO must be in sync with brand promises on other media platforms. In the autumn-winter season of 2013, Allen Solly launched the third part of its Colour Lab theme, in which a customer could pick any colour from a display wall of swatches, sleeve mocks, or even an iPad. A selected garment would be dyed in the exact same colour. This campaign was heavily marketed by the brand, and simultaneously the season’s VM was designed around the same concept. Yet, there are only a few brands which lay such emphasis on synchronisingthe personality of their VM with other communications. VM is often perceived to be only about window displays, without much thought to the store environment, the brand, or the product, which can make a customer feel disconnected. If you take a look at the local brands today, we see better reference points, visually; the quality of VM is better. But if you actually look at the ability of visual merchandisers to understand business and interpret VM into the business objectives, I still feel that there is a long way to go. Nowadays with graphics, media, lighting, etc. it is easier to create an impact, but whether it will help in achieving sales, we can’t say. Some of the larger brands do have a strategic approach to VM, but many others are just tactical.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Challenges that VM faces in India
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Like any emerging space, VM has expanding opportunities but also testing challenges.One of the major challenges that most industry professionals face is the availability and quality of vendors. Working with the vendor base, is the biggest nightmare.The major reasons that industry seniors cite for the incompetency of the vendors are: lack of  technology, limited innovation, uneducated and unskilled labour, and limited material exploration. The vendors are not organised,they have communication problems and quality issues. There are a few good vendors,but none who provide a one-stop-solution to all VM problems. And that is where India is lacking. There are no vocational courses, no support to vendors and their systems in the country.Another area that needs immediate attention is the shortage of reliable organizations that provide intellectual and analytical services such as trend analysis, brand audits, benchmarking and competitor analysis. </p>
