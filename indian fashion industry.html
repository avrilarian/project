<div class="articlehead">India's date with Fashion</div>

<div class="articlebyline">April 12, 2016<br>
<em>by</em> DIVYA NARAYANAN</div>
<br>

<div class="articlebody">
  <p>Fashion is an evolving subject. Yesterday's fashion will undoubtedly resurface again as fashion moves its way through the trend cycles time and time again. Fashion refers to styles of dress (but can also include cuisine, literature, art, architecture, and general comportment) that are popular in a culture at any given time.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The History    </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The total range of costumes in India is considerably expanded between the 8th and the 12th centuries. Interesting and useful accounts of geographers and chroniclers, especially those of Arab and Chinese origin throw light on the Indian costumes in vogue at different times in history. In their accounts, Masudi, Idrisi and Ibn Hawqal speak of Indian cotton with a sense of wonder and awe. With the arrival of the Mughals in the 16th century, new garments like qaba, jama, piraban, lilucba, liba, kasaba, and the like began to be used. These kinds of costumes are also found illustrated in the historical works like the Babar nama, the Tawatlkb-i-kbandan-i-Taimuriya and the Tarikb-i-fi. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Abu'l Fazl provides probably the best documentation that we have of the costumes of India from any single source prior to the 19th century. He mentions that Akbar had replaced the names of several garments with new and pleasing terms. Muslin from undivided India was an important commodity of export and a high fashion fabric in Europe and other parts of the world.    </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Indian costumes like the silk saris, brightly mirrored cholis, colorful lehangas and the traditional salwar-kameezhave fascinated many a travelers over the centuries. Although sari is only one of the many traditional garments worn by women, yet it has become the national dress of Indian women. The tightly fitted, short blouse worn under a sari is a choli, which evolved as a form of clothing in 10th century AD. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Though the majority of Indian women wear traditional costumes, the men in India can be found in more conventional western clothing. Shirts and trousers are worn by men from all the regions of India. However, men in villages wear traditional attires like kurtas, lungis, dhotis and pyjamas. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Indian dressing styles are marked by many variations, both religious and regional and one is likely to witness a plethora of colors, textures and styles in garments worn by the Indians. Apart from this, the rich tradition of Indian embroidery has long been made use of by fashion designers from other countries. India prides in works like Zardozi, Dabka, brocades, Pashmina, Jamawar and bandhni. It seems paradoxical that fashion is considered a young concept in India since the first fashion show was held only in 1958. Jeannie Naoroji wins the credit for initiating the first wave of fashion shows in India and for giving a degree of professionalism to such shows. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since then, there has been growing consciousness among the Indian men and women towards the fashion, styles and designs of the dresses they wear. Several institutes like National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), Indian Institute of Fashion Technology (IIFT) and other fashion academies have been established where the students are taught to translate their creativity into dresses and fabric designs. The media has also played an important role in the fashion boom. Good coverage is provided to the fashion world and several magazines are specifically devoted only to the fashion scene. The proliferation of fashion-based programmes on the satellite television channels has increased the consciousness of the average Indian masses about the changing trends in the global fashion. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The 'apparel', 'clothing', 'garment', 'fashion' and 'lifestyle' industries have undergone two significant changes since the beginning of the new century. With the dismantling of quotas since 2005, exporters of apparel are free from restrictions of quotas and only competitiveness through 'scale', 'quality' and 'innovation' matter now. The other change that happened around the same time was the rapid growth of the domestic fashion retail industry with recent exponential expansion of e-tailing/m-commerce/omni-channels, etc. Building competitiveness of the apparel industry is the biggest challenge in the context of immense competition from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc. The local domestic garment industry has a CAGR of 15-18 per cent per annum and the apparel exports around 8-10 per cent. The fashion/design education curricula, therefore, need to be industry-led and capable of "leading industry" as well.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the past one decade the Indian fashion industry has moved from the embryonic stage to a blossoming take-off. Fashion designers have contributed substantially to the spread of fashion as a driving force, both among Indian consumers and select segments of Western markets. India can now boast of dozens of leading fashion designers, who can match any European fashion designer in their concepts, styles and designs. Ritu Beri, Rohit Bal, Ritu Kumar, Abraham and Thakore, Deepika Govind, Gitanjali Kashyap and many others. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Statistics </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Indian retail market is expected to demonstrate a promising year-on-year growth of 6% to reach USD 865 billion, by 2023, from the current USD 490 billion. The share of apparel in India’s retail market is 8%, corresponding to a value of USD 40 billion. In addition to fashion apparel, the growing demand for fashion accessories makes the Indian fashion market both interesting and lucrative. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A rising number of urban and small town consumers purchasing branded fashion have led to the growth of branded organi-zed retail industry in India. With government allowing up to 100 percent foreign investment in single brand retail, many foreign labels are eyeing an entry into this lucrative market. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It comes as little surprise then, after Zara’s successful run in the country that many high-end foreign labels are planning to open stores in the country. Recently Massimo Dutti and The Limited made their formal entry into India and over a dozen brands are rumored to be next in line for entry, including H&M, The Gap and Uniqlo.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There has been a major shift in the way consumers in India are shopping, with interest in fashion increasing and growing willingness to take risks in fashion choices. Brands like Benetton, Zodiac, Z3, Zara, Vero Moda, Calvin Klein, Diesel and Tommy Hilfiger have experienced good sales growth in the country, while names like Zara, Armani, Forever21 or Uniqlo appeal to the Indian audiences, attracting higher per square foot sales compared to the departmental or hypermarket stores. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Indian companies like the Arvind group, Madura Fashion and Lifestyle, Raymond Apparel, Trent Retail, Reliance Retail and Future Group have announced plans to launch their own fashion labels. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When opening a clothing retail business in India for the first time, the location and store appearance are both important factors to consider. Of course, as with any type of business, it is of vital importance to have the proper licenses and permits in order to operate and to be familiar with the policies imposed by the government when it comes to selling goods. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are certain issues to be kept in mind, such as improper infrastructures and hard to crack consumer tastes. The Assocham has called for the removal of infrastructural and various logistical bottlenecks that are proving to be a bane for growth and development of the designer wear segment in India. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Consumption expenditure of households in India is estimated at 43.6 trillion Indian rupee (2010). Expenditure on clothing and footwear contributes around 3.1 trillion Indian rupee, 7.2 percent of the total domestic consumption. Approximately 2 million people are employed in the manufacture of textiles, clothing, leather and footwear in India. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>India's garment industry employs about eight million workers, of which 70 percent are women. The top ten garment importers from India are the United States, China, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, Germany, Bangladesh, Italy, France, Spain and Turkey. Though garment exports grew by a sturdy 18 percent from 2008/2009 to 2011/2012 to 12.95 billion US dollars, India's textile exports grew by a staggering 83 percent in the same time period and have reached a volume of 18.75 billion US dollars. Top competitor China witnessed a four-fold increase of its garment exports since 1990 and other strong garment exporting nations like Bangladesh and Vietnam witnessed much higher increases than India. </p>
