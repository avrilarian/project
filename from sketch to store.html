<div class="articlehead">from Sketch to Store
</div>

<div class="articlebyline">April 12, 2016<br>
<em>by</em> DIVYA RAJENDRAN</div>
<br>

<div class="articlebody">
  <p>A year ago, the International fashion label French Connection came up with a concept with a cheeky twist for their autumn/ winter 2014 campaign: ‘From Sketch to Store’.    </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The black and white campaign maintained French Connection’s irreverent sense of humour, which their customers have come to love and admire. The two-day photo shoot, saw their models being shot in both their natural form and fully clothed. Next, the images were printed and the clothing designs sketched and overlaid to finally complete the process to reveal the models wearing the actual garments from the French Connection AW14 collection. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you look beyond the obvious, you would realize how much is being down to get the concept; turn it into a sketch from where it goes through a lot of process before it ends up in the store. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Product design conceptualization is not the first stage but it is trickle-down effect of a series of steps. These steps are a part of a creative process. To understand the fashion design process we first need to take a look at a typical model of the creative process. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The development and formulation of a range requires rigorous involvement of 18 to 24 months in typical situation, and involves the following steps which we are going to discuss here. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Fashion Forecast    </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The designer simulates upcoming fashion trends for the season by research and analysis of ongoing fashion events like NY fashion show, London Fashion, Paris and Milan fashion show where some of the illustrious designers showcase their collection. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Conceptualization    </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With a fair idea of forthcoming trends in terms of colors, fabrics, trims silhouettes, a designer conceptualizes a theme. A theme may be a set of emotions or a message that a designer is set to weave through his designs. These themes are then translated on to a board full of images, fabrics, trims etc known as Mood Board which are used for creating a range or a collection. Inspirational images and trims from which the final theme is drawn is called Inspiration Board. Just as a painter portrays his mood on a canvas, a designer pours out his creativity on a mood board that sets a stage for product development. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract to real</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Transformation of this array of abstract images into fashion illustrations is done via CAD to assemble a range – silhouette that will fit into that framework of ideas and give a wholesome look to the collection with a due diligence to the brand focus. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Fabric & Trim Selection    </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The range is engineered with the right selection of fabric to render the drape required for the silhouette in optimized cost thereby also upholding the functionality of the garment. Inherent fabric properties like its weight, tenacity, construction are determined at this stage. This is in sync with the brand’s image of promoting certain technology or material </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Trims, embellishment in the form of hand work, computerized embroidery, treadle work are selected to complement the body fabric with due consideration of costs involved. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Color Selection</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Color palette is selected from the mood board in sync with forecasted trends for the upcoming season. Each color selected brings out a persona of the theme. The selected colors are then matched to the closest pantone shades available. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Range Planning    </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While the actual fabric and trim selection is being done, the garment imitation is constructed in muslin and donned on mannequin or the mannequin is draped and pinned in a fabric to visualize the look of garment and consequently remodelled    </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The number of samples in a line depends on the type of garment, the price range of the brand, the method of distribution and the kind of categories that the brand caters to.  Certain number of garments is planned for each type of fabric selected and for each of the various categories of garment in which the brand specializes in.  A certain proportion of the line is dedicated to basics and a certain proportion personifies high end fashion. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Style Selection & Feasibility study.    </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The line is appraised and ‘weeded’ with a due assessment of financial and production feasibility of the style and the goals and budgets of brand for the season. Intensive focus on cost optimization leads to rejig of styles and material to come up with the most feasible products. This is followed by first cut range presentation of samples produced in actual fabric being reviewed by buyers, retailers, top notches of management depending on the brand format. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So here ends the first phase of range planning for upcoming season, setting a backdrop for the next phase of product development and sampling leading to bulk production. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The least glamorous, but possibly the most important aspect of bringing a fashion product or collection to market is production and manufacturing.
    Production describes the process by which concepts are made into a saleable physical product. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In most cases, this means going from a small set of samples or prototypes to commercial quantities of the item or style, often across multiple sizes, colours and patterns. As you can imagine, it’s impossible to separate production from the overall success of a brand, as great concepts can be designed, developed and sold, but a fashion business will ultimately live or die based on what is produced and delivered to the end consumer. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For most small fashion brands and start-ups, finding sources of production is the most challenging element to get right. Too often, early-stage businesses leave this until too late, and sometimes find themselves with orders to fulfil, but nobody to produce them. This is something to avoid at all cost. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While there are endless options for production, both domestic and international, finding quality suppliers can be difficult, especially in the UK and and USA, where many top young fashion designers are based. As a result, many in the industry tend to be secretive and protective of their production sources. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In recent years, producers in France and Italy have become more open to working with young designers. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing and Planning  </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Production partners are identified early in the process because their execution capabilities and associated costs need to be figured in to your early design decisions, and ultimately into your pricing. Then, by simple comparisons of these prices to your quoted costs, you should be able to tell whether they will allow you to make enough profit margin on each item, at the right level of quality.    </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Many designers ask what a reasonable margin target should be. The answer, of course, varies depending on the size of your business, its overhead, development, sampling costs and many other factors. Most companies try to achieve close to 50 percent margins at wholesale and over 70 percent in retail. But again, there are no hard and fast rules, as each circumstance requires different treatment. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Shiipping and Delivery
  </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When goods are ready and approved to be released, you will likely have them shipped or delivered. Some companies will "drop ship" directly to their own retail stores or accounts. Most often, the goods are received in an office or distribution warehouse. Once you take possession of the final products, you should make sure to pull some (or all) of the units to check for quality on execution. This extra time and money is well spent considering that your customer or account is likely to return any faulty or ill-fitting product. Remember to have a clear understanding of any packing parameters required by specific accounts, as failure to adhere to these parameters can result in charge backs and even order cancellations.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All in all, production can be the most complicated and cumbersome part of running a fashion business. If you have the resources to hire an experienced production manager, they will often be able to bring both know-how and sourcing contacts to your company. In fact, a production specialist is often one of the first hires a growing brand will make. Those of you still considering a career direction in fashion, and who have a mind for managing complex processes and logistics, and an eye for product, should keep this in mind as it is consistently one of the most in-demand skills in the fashion industry. </p>
